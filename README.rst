Status
------
This `python-consul <https://github.com/cablehead/python-consul>`_ author may be a little busy, I will maintain a version
`python-consul2 <https://github.com/poppyred/python-consul2>`_,
welcome to use. The new consul version was used(v1.6.1). Progressively
implement all API interfaces in the future

There's a few API endpoints still to go to expose all features available in
Consul v1.6.1. If you need an endpoint that's not in the documentation, just
open an issue and I'll try and add it straight away.
